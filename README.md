No Launcher Tool
============
A basic tool for some older games (most noticably LithTech based), which you can use to skip the game's launcher.

How to use:
------------
1. Rename original game exe (not launcher) to something else and place No Launcher Tool in its place.
2. Launch the game's launcher and let it start the game (since you've replaced game's exe file, it will create SuiLauncher.cfg containing exe name, work directory and command line arguments).
3. Rename launcher to something else and replace it with No Launcher tool.
4. Restore original game exe file.
5. Launch No Launcher Tool (this will start the game process with all of the parameters it'd normally receive from Launcher - as an added bonus, it will enable you to expend its command line arguments as some launchers don't transfer them).
